        <h1> The 5 Most Weight-Loss-Friendly Foods on The Planet </h1>
        <p>Not all calories are created equal.
            Different foods go through different metabolic pathways in your body. 
            They can have vastly different effects on your hunger, hormones and the number of calories you burn. 
            Here are the 20 most weight-loss-friendly foods on earth that are supported by science.</p><br>
        <h2>1. WHOLE EGGS </h2>
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1553163147-622ab57be1c7?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MjN8fHdob2xlJTIwZWdnfGVufDB8fDB8fA%3D%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60" class="photo5"><br>
        <p>Once feared for being high in cholesterol, whole eggs have been making a comeback.
            Although a high intake of eggs raises the levels of “bad” LDL-cholesterol in some people, they are one of the best foods to eat if you need to lose weight. They are high in protein and fat, and are very satiating.(1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source).    
            One study in 30 overweight women showed that eating eggs for breakfast, instead of bagels, increased feelings of fullness (satiety) and made participants eat less for the next 36 hours </p>
       <br><br>
            <div class="summary">
                <h1> Summary </h1><br>
                <h3>Eggs are very filling and nutrient-dense. Compared to refined carbs like bagels, eggs can suppress appetite later in the day and may even promote weight loss.</h3>

            </div><br><br>
            <h2> 2. BOILED POTATOES </h2>
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1528451635828-f28cd48439a7?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTJ8fGJvaWxlZCUyMHBvdGF0b2VzfGVufDB8fDB8fA%3D%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60" class="photo6"><br>
            <p>White potatoes seem to have fallen out of favor for some reason.
                However, they have several properties that make them a perfect food — both for weight loss and optimal health.                
                They contain an incredibly diverse range of nutrients — a little bit of almost everything you need.              
                There have even been accounts of people living on nothing but potatoes alone for extended periods of time.               
                They’re particularly high in potassium, a nutrient that most people don’t get enough of and that plays an important role in blood pressure control.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="summary">
            <h1> Summary </h1><br>
            <h3>Boiled potatoes are among the most filling foods. They’re particularly good at reducing your appetite, potentially suppressing your food intake later in the day.</h3>

        </div><br><br>
        <h2> 3. BEANS AND LEGUMES </h2>
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1564894809611-1742fc40ed80?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8Mnx8YmVhbnMlMjBhbmQlMjBsZWd1bWVzfGVufDB8fDB8fA%3D%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60" class="photo7"><br>
        <p>Some beans and other legumes can be beneficial for weight loss.
            This includes lentils, black beans, kidney beans and some others.            
            These foods tend to be high in protein and fiber, which are two nutrients that have been shown to lead to satiety.          
            They also tend to contain some resistant starch.          
            The main problem is that a lot of people have difficulties tolerating legumes. For this reason, it’s important to prepare them properly.</p>
       <br>
       <div class="summary">
        <h1> Summary </h1><br>
        <h3>Beans and legumes are a good addition to your weight loss diet. They’re both high in protein and fiber, contributing to feelings of fullness and a lower calorie intake.</h3>

    </div><br><br>

        <h2> 4. AVOCADOS </h2>
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580823673202-ef0405ae5b52?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTJ8fGF2b2NhZG9zfGVufDB8fDB8fA%3D%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60" class="photo8"><br>
       <p>Avocados are a unique fruit.
        While most fruits are high in carbs, avocados are loaded with healthy fats.   
        They’re particularly high in monounsaturated oleic acid, the same type of fat found in olive oil.    
        Despite being mostly fat, avocados also contain a lot of water and fiber, making them less energy-dense than you may think.</p>
        <br>
       <div class="summary">
        <h1> Summary </h1><br>
        <h3>Avocados are a good example of a healthy fat source you can include in your diet while trying to lose weight. Just make sure to keep your intake moderate.</h3>

    </div><br><br>
        <h2> 5. APPLE CIDER VINEGAR </h2>
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1605092281878-f23d0f74d071?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8Nnx8YXBwbGUlMjBjaWRlciUyMHZpbmVnYXJ8ZW58MHx8MHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60" class="photo9"> <br>
        <p>Apple cider vinegar is incredibly popular in the natural health community.
            It’s often used in condiments like dressings or vinaigrettes, and some people even dilute it in water and drink it.           
            Several human-based studies suggest that apple cider vinegar can be useful for weight loss.</p><br>

            <div class="summary">
                <h1> Summary </h1><br>
                <h3>Adding apple cider vinegar to your vegetable salad may help curb your appetite, potentially leading to greater weight loss.</h3>
